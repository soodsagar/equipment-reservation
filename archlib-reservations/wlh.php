			  <li>Don't turn the laptop and XGA on until EVERYTHING is plugged in (including the laptop-to-port cable). Then, turn on the XGA first, immediately followed by the laptop.</li>
			  <li>In Weston Lecture Hall I, use the computer port 1 in front of the lecture hall stage.  In Weston Lecture Hall II, use the computer port 1 on the wall directly ahead of you as you enter the room.</li>
			  <li>When the laptop boots up, make sure you that you type the username and password correctly. Again, make sure that you have the VGA and ethernet cables plugged into the ports. Now, try to open your lecture, for example, in MS PowerPoint, or the Internet broswer, Mozilla-Firefox or Internet Explorer.</li>
